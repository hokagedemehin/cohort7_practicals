Ghana money rituals: Why ritual murder dey on de rise for Ghana,"Ritual murder be major issue Ghanaians dey deal with after de country start dey record multiple cases dis year. In de past, some of de most infamous ritual murderers target women, but recently children be de target of ritual murders for Ghana. But question wey dey on de minds of many people be why ritual murder dey on de rise for Ghana.  Unemployment be major challenge which most Ghanaian youth dey face.  Dis unemployment challenge create economic hardships give young people who dey look for get rich quick schemes to escape poverty.  Security Analyst, Adam Bonaa dey argue say jobless youth dey take up criminal means to survive.  ''While internet fraud, robbery, money laundering den tins be criminal activities de youth dey engage in, some people dey see ritual killings as option. ""De killings dey happen sake of Spiritualists who dey promise patrons money"", he talk.  Popular traditional priest, Nana Kwaku Bonsam explain dis better, according to him, 'fake' traditional priests dey demand for people to satisfy some very difficult conditions like bringing human parts den tins. Dis be one of de reasons why ritual killings dey on de rise.  Dis show in de recent Kasoa killing case where two teenagers allegedly kill 12 year old neighbour sake of fetish priestess allegedly direct dem to bring human parts. ""De misconception be say once dem use human blood do rituals, dis dey make de vodoo more potent"" Nana Kwaku Bonsam talk.  De implication be de needless killings to meet conditions of fetish priests off late. For popular traditional priest, Kwaku Bonsam, de use of human blood no dey make any vodoo potent.  After de murder of three kids for Abesim, he reveal say most fetish priests dey request for human parts be scammers.  According to Kwaku Bonsam, ""de only blood sacrifice traditional priest dey need to perform any ritual be animal blood."" ""But some traditionalists who want make money from unsuspecting people, dey charge den big monies in addition, dem go request human parts which dem know say go be difficult to do"", he explain.  ""Once you no fit do am de money you give dem lock, again you no go expect any vodoo money sake of you no bring de human parts"", Nana Kwaku Bonsam add.  ""In de end, monies wey all de people who visit carry give dem as part of de ritual go be for dem - that be how dem dey scam people"", he explain.  Another cause of ritual killings be de increase in adverts by fetish priests who dey advertise say dem fit double money or give people charm to make money.  De failure of key state institutions who for control content on public radio and TV dey make some youth vulnerable to de spiritual scammers. Those who go follow de public adverts, radio and TV shows go visit de fetish priests for money solutions dey end up going extreme lengths to kill innocent people as part of de ritual process.  Early dis year, Ghana Communicate Minister, Ursula Owusu make police arrest owner of Thunder TV and Ice1 TV sake of dem dey broadcast shows on money doubling rituals den stuff. According to Ursula Owusu, ""unregulated television stations dey promote some content which dey affect public order, public morality den rights."" Authorities for Ghana start dey shut down TV den radio stations who dey run adverts on ritual money den tins.  Security analyst, Dr Kwesi Aning believe say Ghana go continue to experience crimes like ritual murder sake of people dey see am as profitable venture.  According to am, ""crime turn profitable venture in dis country such that we no know what to do. ""Dis in addition to de weak criminal justice system for Ghana which dey fail to arrest and prosecute criminals dey punish  encourage more crime"", Aning add. Security agencies for Ghana over de years fail to deal with crimes in de country like robbery, kidnapping den ritual murders.  Dis according to analysts dey encourage more people to attempt criminal activities like ritual murder of kids sake of dem feel say police no go investigate and bring dem to justice. In 2019, de kidnapping of three girls for Takoradi go under police radar until media start dey report on de matter.  De many media reports put pressure on de Ghana Police Service to investigate, identify suspects den later retrieve de bodies of de girls.  After media make de issue of kidnapping a national issue, de police service make de issue step up dema investigations leading to arrest and prosecution of de suspects behind Takoradi girls who dem discover dead.  Ghana dey classify murder as first degree felony, publishable by death.  Ghana lawyer, Oliver Barker-Vormawor explain say based on section 46 of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) people who commit murder go suffer de death penalty. Despite de death sentence, Ghana shun dey effect de death sentence since 1993.

LAWRO PREDICTIONS Games go kick off at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated SATURDAY Tottenham neva do anything spectacular so far but dem don do really well to win every Premier League game 1-0 - especially because I feel say dia defence na weak link. I'd still fancy Spurs to win dis one and continue their 100% winning start, even though Son no dey fit, but I no dey to worried about Crystal Palace wait for dia first league win under Patrick Vieira. Lawro prediction: 0-1 Justin prediction: Dis game go tough for Palace. Dem no dey look great, but Spurs good. 0-3 Arsenal results so far dey very bad so far but surely dem go get something out of dis bottom-of-di-table clash. We know say Norwich go fight hard dis season to avoid relegation. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: Arsenal get better players pass Norwich have, but as tins be now e no look good. Norwich feel say dem fit get something dia. 1-1 Na so far, so good for Brentford wey still dey unbeaten afta three league games. Brighton go expect a noisy atmosphere like di one wey we saw when di Bees beat Arsenal for di first game of di season because di home fans go just dey enjoy dia self. Justin's prediction: Brentford na classic newly promoted team wit plenty ginger - , so I dey support di Bees here. 1-0 As I dey tok, Manchester City still dey hope say dem go dey allowed to play Brazil duo Ederson and Gabriel Jesus but I still fancy them here without those two, even though e go mean say third-choice keeper Scott Carson go step in because Zack Steffen dey also unavailable. Leicester get a  bit of history against Pep Guardiola' Manchester City, including beating them for  last month Community Shield, but di Foxes go face a different animal dis time. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Justin' prediction: I no want to write Leicester off, but Manchester City dey look pretty strong. 1-2 Newcastle badly need a win, but Old Trafford, on di day wey Ronaldo dey return, no be di place or time to get am. Lawro prediction: 3-0 Justin prediction: Based on Ronaldo history and how im dey always marks every occasion to do something special, I dey expect a goal from am and a win for Manchester United, based on say Newcastle no dey form right now. 3-0 Southampton na another team without a victory so far but I feel say their performances  better pass their results for their first three games. West Ham, meanwhile, don win two out of three and go maintain dia 100% record if to say dem no allow dia lead slip twice for home against Crystal Palace before di international break. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Justin's prediction:  1-0 Watford don lose their past two games afta dem starting their season with a win ova Aston Villa and I no dey see that run ending dia weekend. Wolves dey without a point or even a goal so far but dem don create plenty chances and surely that go soon change , whether Mexican striker Raul Jimenez dey allowed to play or not.
